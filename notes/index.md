# Notes

Over the years I've been keeping notes as text files in `~/Dropbox/notes`. This has worked well--it is easy to search text files in a file system, and I'm not bound to any structure.

Each _entry_ is small, and it helps me keep track of how to do something specific. Perhaps some of these pointers might help you...
