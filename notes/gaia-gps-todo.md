1. There are many repeated items in the map layers list.

2. Sometimes when there is no GPS lock, the timer stops ticking. That's fine, but I can't make a waypoint or take a picture.

3. When one takes a picture, that picture should also get into the phone's photo album.

4. Sometimes the map becomes completely unresponsive, also when (I think) thke app hasn't yet gotten a GPS lock.

5. When a track is done, it's not obvious what we should do. I just press back, but there really should be an OK.

6. More than 2 widgets in the bottom.

7. Material Design buttons.
