# gitbook plugins

Here is a list of gitbook plugins I'm interested in.

* [Image Captions](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/image-captions)
    - Provides nice little captions below images.
* [Toggle Chapters](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/toggle-chapters)
    - Only shows the active branch of chapters in the summary panel.
* [Splitter](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/splitter)
    - Allows you to resize the summary panel. Note: this has a bug in mobile that makes it unusable. When clicking on a link, the panel will disappear, but the main content will not move back to the left.

## Themes

Themes are a special type of plugin. Theme's I'm interested in:

* [theme-api](https://github.com/GitbookIO/theme-api)
