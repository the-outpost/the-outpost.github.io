# Gitbook

This website is built with [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com). The actual website is at:

https://github.com/hallahan/theoutpost.io

To alter css in your gitbook from the given theme, you simply create:

```
styles/website.css
```

Obviously this will become verbose, and at that point, it will be good to make a custom theme.

I have, but am not currently using:

## Gitbook Plugins

Here is a list of gitbook plugins I'm interested in.

* [Image Captions](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/image-captions)
    - Provides nice little captions below images.
* [Toggle Chapters](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/toggle-chapters)
    - Only shows the active branch of chapters in the summary panel.
* [Expandable Chapters](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/expandable-chapters)
    - Similar to Toggle Chapters
* [Splitter](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/splitter)
    - Allows you to resize the summary panel. Note: this has a bug in mobile that makes it unusable. When clicking on a link, the panel will disappear, but the main content will not move back to the left.

## Themes

Themes are a special type of plugin. Besides the default plugin, the most thoroughly develped theme I have found is:

* [theme-api](https://github.com/GitbookIO/theme-api)
