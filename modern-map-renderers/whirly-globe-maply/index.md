WhirlyGlobe | Maply is a unique mapping library, particularly in that it supports both a globe view and a map view of the world. Development began back in 2012, and over the course of several years, it has become one of the most widely used mapping libraries for iOS apps. 

I have been a long time avid user of [Gaia GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com), and I was excited to learn that this is the underlying library they use for iOS. [Other apps](http://mousebird.github.io/mousebird/apps.html) you may have used include: the [National Geographic World Atlas](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/national-geographic-world/id364733950?mt=8) and Weather.io's [Dark Sky](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.darksky.darksky).

The feature set is quite large, and several include:

* Vector tile support using Mapnik XML Styles
* Full 3D Terrain
* Animated Rasters
* Animated 3D Objects & Annotations
* Marker Clustering
* 2D & 3D Labels with Dynamic Placement
* Offline MBTiles
* Detailed Vector Styling with Feature Selection
* LIDAR Point Clouds

Some of these features are quite advanced, and if you want to render LIDAR point clouds along with, maybe, 3D terrain, all rendered offline--this is the only open source renderer out there that will do what you need.

Also, if you need a specific feature implemented for your product or app, you can pay Mousebird for that feature to be developed. It is important to consider this, because a venture-backed product company inherently has a more complex business strategy--one that may or may not align with your priority.

## Android Support

2016 has been the year of Android for WhirlyGlobe. A good chunk of the functionality found in iOS has been bridged to the Android Java API, and you can see the fruit of this push in [Dark Sky](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.darksky.darksky). 

In July 2016, I was able to help with this effort by writing tutorials for [WhirlyGlobe | Maply on Android](http://mousebird.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/tutorial/android/getting-started.html).
